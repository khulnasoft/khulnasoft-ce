As explained in `final_explanation.md`, I cannot fix the "Could not find compatible versions" error by installing an older Bundler version (like 1.17.3) because that version of Bundler is incompatible with the current Ruby version (3.4.7).

The `NoMethodError: undefined method 'untaint'` error, which occurred after installing Bundler 1.17.3 and trying to run `bundle _1.17.3_ install`, clearly indicates this Ruby version incompatibility. Older Bundler versions rely on methods that have been removed in Ruby 3.4.7.

Therefore, the only way to resolve this is to address the underlying Ruby version incompatibility, as detailed in `final_explanation.md`. I cannot proceed with fixing this specific Bundler error without first resolving the Ruby environment issue, which requires significant changes to your system or an application upgrade.
